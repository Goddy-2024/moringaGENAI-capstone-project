# React State Management Capstone Project  
*A beginner-friendly hands-on project demonstrating how to manage and share user data in React.*

---

## Overview of the Chosen Tech: React + State Management

This capstone focuses on **React**, a powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.

The goal of this project is to help beginners **understand how data (state)** flows between components in React using:
- **`useState`** hook for local component state  
- **Lifting state up** to share data between sibling components  
- **Props** for communication between parent and child  

You’ll build a **Login → Profile** workflow where a user logs in, their data is stored in state, and they can later view and edit that data in a profile page.
